neptune-1.06:
  - Included BFGMiner (ver. 5.0.0);
  - CGMiner updated to v4.9.1;
  - Eliminated another possible source of spurious CGMiner/BFGMiner restarts
    (monitordcdc: Send "restart die" requests to miner only if die is not OFF)

neptune-1.05:
  - cgminer core updated to 4.9.0;
  - cgminer Neptune driver updates:
    - memory leak fixed;
    - some logging issues fixed;
  - knc-asic is updated to v2.5, which includes FPGA update to 5.02;
  - with knc-asic v2.5 also comes updated waas with support for "OFF" state for dies,
    so added support for OFF dies.

neptune-1.02:
  - Correctly create and apply default advanced settings on
    reset to factory defaults by power button
  - cgminer v4.4.1-knc3.6: Add API call knc-configure-die for dynamically
    add/remove dies
  - Fix problem: cgminer restarts frequently

neptune-1.00:
  - cgminer v4.4.1-knc3.5: Major rework of cgminer KnC driver:
      CPU performance improvement and better error handling
      This also fixes errors while viewing advanced settings page.
  - Update asic_cmd to v1.6
  - Print out board temperature, average DC/DC temp and clock rate on Status page
    for each ASIC board.
  - Remove checkbox "BFGMiner"
  - Detect enabled asics dynamically; do not use stats.knc file for that.
      Get rid of stats.knc file completely
  - There might be ASIC board plugged into slot 0
    (LCD screen does not prevent this)

neptune-rc9:
  - minor change in cgminer: cleanup statistics a bit
  - Make sure that after factory reset advanced.conf is recreated with default values
  - Fix bug: static IP can not be set from web interface
  - Update asic_cmd to v1.3

neptune-rc8:
  - Minor fixes in cgminer:
    -- Change priority of some log messages
    -- Missing closing zero in api string
  - Do not run monitordcdc if there is no cgminer.conf
  - Stop all dcdc before reboot
  - Improvements in waas and monitordcdc regarding power-cycling ASIC boards
  - Detect hardware configuration changes during runtime
      Useful when power-cycling ASIC boards
  - Button "Factory Defaults" on the Advanced page now works without producing garbage in response

neptune-rc6:
  Initial public release; shipped with first few Neptune miners.
